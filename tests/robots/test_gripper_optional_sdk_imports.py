"""Hold the gripper package to its "no hardware SDK to read a config" promise.

``lerobot.grippers`` documents that config classes carry no hardware-SDK import,
so an arm config parses and ``--robot.type`` registers on a host that has none of
the Xense / TacCap / XGripper wheels installed. Nothing enforced that, and it
silently stopped being true twice:

  - ``grippers/serial/__init__.py`` imported the driver eagerly, so the
    config-only import in ``grippers/__init__.py`` ran it and pulled in xgripper.
  - Upstream, ``xgripper`` imported a tactile-feedback controller at module
    scope, so even the pure-serial driver required xensesdk (fixed in XGripper
    39c7aad).

Neither shows up in a normal test run, because the dev machine has every SDK
installed. These tests hide them at import time to make the promise checkable.
