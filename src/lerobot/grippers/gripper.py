"""Base class for gripper implementations.

Grippers are arm-agnostic: an arm robot holds one (or one per side) and drives it
through the small contract below, without knowing which backend is underneath.
Two backends exist: ``serial`` (USB-serial parallel jaw) and ``taccap_follower``
(the centric TacCap gripper).

Normalized position convention, uniform across every backend:

    0.0  →  fully closed
    1.0  →  fully open

Subclasses must implement connection lifecycle, ``is_connected`` and the two
position methods. ``initialize_gripper_position`` has a working default — command
a target, then poll until it is reached — that a backend overrides only if its SDK
offers a genuine blocking move.

Grippers do not carry tactile data. The visuotactile sensors on a TacCap gripper
are surfaced as ordinary cameras (auto-discovered off the gripper's USB hub), not
through the gripper object.
