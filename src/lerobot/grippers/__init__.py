"""Arm-agnostic gripper drivers, shared across robot packages.

Layout mirrors ``lerobot.cameras``: a ``Gripper`` ABC and a ``GripperConfig``
choice registry at the top, one subpackage per backend underneath.

Config classes are imported eagerly — they carry no hardware-SDK import, so arm
configs and ``--robot.type`` registration keep working on a host without the
Xense/TacCap/XGripper SDKs. Driver classes are NOT imported here; get one through
``make_gripper_from_config``, which imports only the branch it needs.

That promise reaches through each backend's ``__init__`` too, which is easy to
break by adding one convenient re-export: importing a submodule runs its package
first, so an eager driver import there would drag the SDK in for anyone who only
parsed a config. ``tests/robots/test_gripper_optional_sdk_imports.py`` hides the
SDKs at import time and fails if that happens again — it has happened twice.
