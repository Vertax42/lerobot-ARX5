"""Factory that turns a gripper config into its driver.

Replaces the ``_make_gripper`` isinstance-chain that was copy-pasted into each
bimanual arm. Imports are deferred into each branch on purpose: the Xense and
TacCap SDKs are optional builds, so importing this module must not drag in a
native extension the host may not have. Only the branch you actually select
gets imported.
