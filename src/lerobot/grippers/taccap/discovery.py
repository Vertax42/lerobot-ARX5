"""Auto-discovery of the per-side devices that ship with a TacCap follower gripper.

A TacCap gripper is a self-contained USB hub carrying the gripper MCU (a serial
device), one wrist UVC camera, and two GSPS visuotactile sensors. This module
sniffs the two grippers via the TacCap SDK and resolves, for each side (left /
right), the identifiers the existing LeRobot camera stack needs:

  - wrist camera : a V4L2 device *name* (e.g. "XCA25Z0011s"), derived from the
                   gripper firmware SN (product prefix "TCGU01" → "XC"). Consumed
                   by OpenCVCameraConfig, which resolves names via v4l2-ctl.
  - tactile      : the two GSPS sensor serial numbers (e.g. "GSPS01A27Z0094"),
                   enumerated by xensesdk and matched to the *side* by USB
                   topology (same USB hub as that side's gripper MCU). Which
                   *finger* of that gripper each one sits on is a separate
                   question, answered by the serial's own trailing-digit parity
                   when the keys are built — see ``camera_injection``.

Side comes from the firmware-burned gripper SN via the TacCap SDK, never guessed.
